# Vue Website and Spring Lambda Backend for Email Service

This repository contains two main components:
1. `main-website` - A [Personal Website](https://egorzadorin.com) built using VueJS, HTML and CSS.
2. `spring-lambda` - A frontend component for an [Email Service](https://github.com/EgorZadorin/poc-aws-lambda-spring-boot), built using same technical stack.

Both applications are included in a single repository for the convenience of using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy them to an AWS EC2 instance on each git push.

## Prerequisites

## Build and Run 

Navigate to the `main-website` or `spring-lambda` directory and execute the following commands:
```

npm run serve
